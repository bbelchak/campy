Introduction
==================
Campy is designed to be a self-contained, self-sufficient bot for Campfire.
It is designed to be highly extensible through a very simple plugin interface.

Setup
==================
Campy is easily set up. Just clone the repository, configure the settings to be appropriate for your environment, then run:
	python ./campy.py

Developing plugins
==================
Developing plugins is fun and easy. Check out the plugins directory for a couple of examples. I am sure there are improvements that can be made, but it's a start.

TODO
===================
* Package using distutils or something similar.
* Start as a daemon
* Develop some other plugins
** 'seen' plugin
** 'reminders' plugin
* Further flesh out the plugins system.
